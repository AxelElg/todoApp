## typescript & sass todolist

this is a simple todo website, using typescript and sass.
to set this hole thing up you need to first clone this repo,
once that's done you need to first run the prompt command

\$ npm install

after that you run

\$ npm run build-js

and

\$ npm run build-css

after this the application is ready for usage.
currently you can only use this application by opening the src/index.html file (this will be changed in the future).
